VCS (short for Visual Character System) is an sdl-based graphics system designed to provide the basic functionality of ncurses, plus some extras. It is designed to merge the simplicity and ease-of-use of ascii-art graphics with the capabilities of modern graphic systems.

##### Features
* SDL window which renders an array of ASCII characters in a style much like ncurses.
* Character foreground and background colors configurable by RGB; no more memorizing color codes
* Keyboard reading handled through SDL
* Shaders allow you to color characters per-pixel, and even animate based on arbitrary input.
